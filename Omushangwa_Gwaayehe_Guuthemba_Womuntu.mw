Classic RUDE NEIGHBOR stories:
My husband and I live next to the neighbors from hell. The older man who actually works parks his car on the street instead of using his driveway, making it hard to back out of ours. His daughter recently moved in with her young son, and on occasion we smell pot coming from their house as they sit outside and smoke. She screams at her son, who NEVER wears pants, and allows the child to play on top of her car with toys unsupervised. Did I mention he still wears diapers? (He's about four or five!) There are two dogs in the backyard that never receive attention, and my husband and I are especially irritated when we wake in the morning to the sound of the dogs dragging old mattress springs around the backyard. The converted garage looks like a do-it-yourself project gone horribly wrong, and they have the dryer vent sticking out of the converted garage window. On the back deck there is an air-conditioning window unit and all sorts of trash, junk, and gasoline containers. The little boy uses these things for toys. Every two or three weeks the grass is mowed and clippings are left covering the driveway and street (this is illegal where we live). At night the television is so loud we can hear what they are watching in our bedroom. Every time my husband and I do yard work we have to pick up their trash and scraps that land in our yard. They have never weed eated/edged their yard...I guess they aren't familiar with the responsibility of living in a house. Tara, Tulsa, OK
My rude neighbor parks his car and work van across from our driveway making it difficult for us to back in. This man lives on a corner lot and can park any other place. He also stands at his window and gives us the middle finger. He lets his dog crap in other neighbor yards. One time his puppy almost was hit by a car, the car stopped, so he grabbed his puppy and gave the driver of the car a nasty look instead of saying thank you for stopping. In the winter time he never moves his cars off the street for snow removal, and never gets fined. I could go on and on but I'll stop now. Thanks D from Pa
I moved to CO from Los Angeles a little over a year ago due to the high cost of living. I found a lovely little condo community and soon thereafter purchased my home. Gee, life was grand and I had accomplished a huge goal. I move in all is well for a about a week. BUT THEN, one early morning, I hear LOUD THUD noises from upstairs. Turns out the workers were getting the place ready for someone to move in... immediately, based on how loud the worker's were, I knew I was in trouble...fast forward a few weeks...neighbor moves in, hell begins. From her bark at all hours of the day and night/run around the house dog (that vibrated the ceiling and ceiling fans)to the visits from her unruly bratty grandchildren, quality of life has taken a backseat. Initialy, I went to speak with her about just how loud the noises were and to ask her to be a little more aware if possible. I was actually nice. She was defensive, said that she basically didn't know what she coudl do, and nothing changed as a result of that visit. Fast forward a few months, and enter her car stealing meth dealing/addicted felon daughter who just got apprehended by DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER.. this trick was coming and going at all hours of the night. Not only that, she brought her worrisome frisky little husky with her... turned out the husky wasn't quite so little... does anyone know what two 20 plus pound dogs sound like playing upstairs?? Enough said... One night the dog started acting out for over an hour (knocking stuff over, running amock, etc.)well after quiet hours. I was furious and this was the beginning of an ongoing war that is still being fought. Sent e-mails to the Builder and HOA (who have been helpful to some degree). The next morning, I left a note on her car window since we kept different schedules... lets just say that note resulted in a visit from the Police... needless to say, I can no longer have contact with MY rude neighbor... many other things have transpired that I won't even go into.. the latest event is that her other daughter (the one with the two brats) has permanently moved in and now the little hellions are here running rampant on a constant basis... she works a night shift, and even after moving into the bedroom in the basement, I still am awakened frequently by how loud they are.... no consideration whatsoever... therefore, I am no longer considerate.... I must say, music turned up full volume works wonders in drowing out those pesky noises from above. And since I'm so tired in the morning from bein awakened during the wee morning hours, I ensure that they too have that same delight when I get up anywhere from 4:30 - 5:30 AM.. I will concede one thing: the Builder is largely at fault as well. I should have investigated the quality of the homes this particular builder has constructed... because there is no way one should be able to hear upstairs neighbors down in a basement!!! The Rude neighbor knows there are building issues; yet they do not even try to be any quieter... "trying" would be enough to satisfy me.. instead she and her daughter do things deliberately and that is what fuels my animosity towards her..... I would sell, but of course, after more than a ten year "seller's market" the minute I purchase, it changes to a "buyers market", so now I'm stuck until the market changes again. N
As with most of the stories, neighbors start out on friendly terms. We did. The our back yard lots are 17 feet wide by about 45 feet long. They put in an inflatable pool that is 12.5 feet in diameter and four feet high on the sides. One time one of the children leaned on the side of the pool and water came in our laundry room through the back door; the pool is up on a hill and our back doors are at the bottom of the hill. We didn't say anything. We got the land surveyed and found out they are on two feet of our tiny lot, so we would like to build a fence on the property line. The pool would have to go; it's a threat to the building if it ruptures plus it has green algae so it looks like a lime margarita; they put kids 5 years and younger in that pool. The lady who owns the house got so mad, threatened to get another surveyor saying ours gave us extra land. She is mad and won't speak to us or look at us, but after the survey line was done, she planted sunflowers on our property to be defiant. My husband crushed them because he doesn't need a rebellious neighbor and now she's left a note for us on our wooden fence. The survey line on our knoll reveals she owns a small strip of it and the retaining wall against the strip of land. She wanted to know what we're going to do about the wall that's on her property?!?!?! The property line shows that the wall is hers and she's responsible for what is on her property. How stupid. I suppose what I can do is report her to the borough if the wall is left neglected and she'll have to pay for repairs to it. I'm going to the borough tomorrow to report about the pool that's not on a lot zoned for that size pool. I will give the kids since they are so small a kiddie pool for them for the size lot they have, not for the adult who wants it for herself. Amy, Royersford, PA
We bought our current house 3 years ago in a nice neighborhood, so our little kids and dog could have a yard. The only catch to our house is that the town allowed higher end condos to be built behind our side of the street. They are not right in my backyard, but they are up on a hill, so they seem a little closer. They put all of the main balconies, four, in the middle, right behind our house. I did some research and learned that these condos are fairly expensive and by searching tax records I was able to determine that most of the people who bought these condos were at least 55 or older. I figured that was okay. Besides, the decks are barely 3' x 3'. Not much to do on these tiny decks, anyways. Well, I was right about the average ages, but was wrong to assume that since the condos were fairly expensive, the decks are tiny, and that since the inhabitants are older that there would not be a trashy neighbor. This one lady is a chain smoker and from what I can tell a fairly heavy drinker. I can hear her beer bottles clanking on her one person, tempered glass patio table. For three years this lady has leaned over her balcony, facing our back yard, for hours at a time. I mean, from the moment she comes home, the days she works, until at least midnight she is on her deck leaning over her balcony, smoking, drinking and gabbing very loudly on her phone. The weekends are even worse because then it is eight in the morning until at least midnight. She never goes anywhere. We have a very nice backyard and deck, which we hardly use because this lady monopolizes the space. I have tried to get over it and ignore her, but it is at the point where she is always out there, leaning over her balcony. Watching us as if we are her personal Truman Show. What is even more maddening is that she has another balcony off her bedroom that is not intrusive to us and also has a walkout basement patio that is behind our privacy fence. I am having a hard time putting in large, mature trees because of how our backyard is set-up and the only way you can block her properly is to rip up the stairs we have going up the hill. I have finally gotten to the point where I walk up the stairs where we have a little deck that is very close to the condos and I just stand there and look at her until she goes inside. Then, a few minutes later she comes back out and I have to go up there, again. She is so trashy, especially since she is 55. I first thought she had a daughter or something, because no way would a 55 year old woman be smoking and gabbing so loud, without thinking about her neighbors. I was wrong. It is embarrassing as well, because when friends come over, after a few times they say things like, "Is that lady always up there leaning over like that". I have never threatened this lady, but I have started to verbalize how trashy she is acting. I want to put my house on the market, not selling because of her, but most people come and look at houses during the evenings and weekends, when she is always out hanging out leaning over her balcony. The way the housing market has cooled I do not want to spend thousands of dollars that I will not get back, just to block the lady so I can sell my house. It is awful. Now, that I very loudly verbalize my displeasure and I walk up to the upper balcony it has gotten a little better, but only for little spurts. I wear my Ipod in my backyard, just to block her out, and I can still hear her inane rambling. We have hardly used our deck or our backyard in three years. I take my kids to the park a lot and they have other activities, but I think it is trashy that someone would invade someone else's space with such manic regularity. I am not even against smokers, though I do not smoke, but her habit dictates that she must be on her deck at all times, to smoke. It is very sick; she probably needs medication to fly, or never goes anywhere because she is afraid to not be smoking. I cannot explain what it is like to always feel someone outside behind your house. She is always there, always, which is very unnerving. Her habit runs her life and I am the one that needs to deal with it, which really sucks. Bill, Green Mountain, Colorado
Using our driveway to go around their own cars, parking in our driveway, driving their scooters through our backyard, blaring music at all hours, throwing their trash in our yard, cussing us out because we let our dogs out to use the bathroom, on our property, they let their dogs roam, they have a fence, they've let their dogs out when ours are out trying to get them fighting. we've heard them trying to break into my car, they've broke into our garage twice, i think to prove a point. we've asked them to turn the music down, we get cussed,we use their driveway, we get cussed, we do nothing and we get cussed. Just Becuss
We definately have the worlds rudest neighbor. We started construction on our new house and that's when we discovered our rude neighbor. First, he knocked down the grade stakes. He then parked his pick-up so that the excavator could not drive on to the lot. We told him very nicely that he had to move or be towed by the excavating company. After the basement was dug, he would throw garbage into the open hole. As the construction continued, he would turn the water on in the basement and let it run all night long. He smashed beer bottles at the house. He stole anything that was left out or if he found it. He stole a role of Tevac. Tevac, is not cheep. Of course we had no actual proof that it was him, but his house is the only one next to ours. We did call the police when he decided to do a burn out on our driveway. The police just talked to him. He blocked our drainage pipe and also throws his cigarette butts on our front lawn. Again we call the police. The police again talk to him and he admits his wrong doing, but that was all. We are going to move into our new home next week. God only knows what our rude neighbor has planned for us, all because we built a house next to his. B and B
I'm in the process of buying a home, so I found this "hell hole" for three months. The landlord forgot to mention that my neighbors were five frat boys. The music blaring never stops. Called the police and they did nothing. Last night was the final straw, tons of cars and drinking at 3 am I had it. To top it off on the 4th one of these "fine young men" exposed himself to me. The landlord won't return calls nor do anything about this dump. I hope, I can survive the next 14 days. P
My neighbors are always causing me and the other neighbors a lot of trouble. Their dogs harrass me. The police don't seem to care they won't do anything about it. I don't know what to do. K
My rude neighbors live across the street from me. The husband is a "minister." The couple have two "grown" children who park their cars in front of my house. My guests can't even park in front of my house. These two grown children frequently block my mailbox. The postperson has often refused to deliver our mail because of this "minister's" children. When I have to park on the street, in front of my home, they look at me like I'm the sinner. M
Mr. Rude bought the house next door in a deed restricted neighborhood in Texas. It was a lovely gentleman's ranch, well kept house on half an acre, 5 acres of pasture land, a barn and storage building for tractor and horse trailer. Previous neighbors took a lot of pride in it. When Mr R moved in, he trashed the yard with appliances, Coke vending machine, building materials and other unidentifiable stuff. Totally filled that half an acre with junk. My favorite was the bi-fold doors that moved around the front yard as the lawn got mowed and the washer and drier that traveled in and out of the garage. Mr Rude went around the neighborhood claiming to be a lawyer and a millionaire and that he was going to buy up our homes. He's actually a plumber and past real estate salesman. He made a little money on real estate in California but the state revoked his real estate license for fraud and dishonest dealings. The house was nice but he overpaid for it - paid about $500k for it. Anyway, he immediately got day workers to dig a 4 foot deep hole in the front yard. That was to be a koi pond, he bragged, but it's nothing more than a mosquito pond. No fish. Then Mr Rude expanded the barn to keep his workers (against the restrictions). Mr R had the workers run a electric concrete mixer and they expanded the driveway around the house to the barn, (so wealthy he couldn't afford concrete delivery in a real mixer?), then added lean-tos to the side of the storage building (without building permits or approval), and parked his plumbing trucks, vans, cable runner and trailer etc under and around the storage building. Oh, I forgot the roosters that crow every 10 seconds (also against the restrictions). He's so pitiful a plumber that he couldn't maintain his sprinkler system and it kept flooding our property (on purpose perhaps?). We had to keep telling him to shut his water off. All of this insanity went on for 3 months. Complaints to the Board of Directors made him clean up the trash but he was ticked off that anyone would complain. He said he put a lot of money into his "improvements". His property looks like shanty town and an industrial park. He was arrogant and condescending. Said we were costing him money and that we didn't like him because he was Mexican. Excuse me! - he was lowering the value of our property. After that incident, men started showing up in the culdesac in the predawn hours looking for work. When we brought forth proof to the Board of Directors that Mr Rude was running a business (an ad he placed using his residential address), all he did was change the address to a PO box. Last time I asked if he could shut off his water because it was flooding our property, he pretended like it wasn't him ("Are you sure? Are you sure? It's dry over here.") and called me white trash. I told him "if I was white trash, what did that make him? He was living next door to me." The nerve! He's the racist. Just goes to show that money and civility don't always go together. He brought home a huge inboard motor boat and parked it in his short driveway. It's so big that it won't fit in the prefab steel building (which could easily house an RV). The man is a fool and we all know a fool and his money are soon parted. Can't wait for him to run through his so he'll move away. D
My neighbors buzzed down a tree in their yard and put the wood in my yard. I asked them to remove it. A couple of days later while I was taking my dog out back I'm greeted by a 15-foot-tall blaze in my yard. Instead of putting it somewhere on their own property to burn, they burnt it on mine. I promptly put up a posted sign the next day. A couple of days later I receive a call from my landlord saying the neighbors are complaining about the posted sign. I explained the reason for it and he said it wouldn't happen again. A couple of weeks later they put all of their garden brush into the area they burnt their tree parts in my yard. So the sign went back up. They ended up complaining again but the landlord didn't care this time. After a freak ice/snow storm a huge branch fell from my tree into each of our backyards. I enlisted a tree-removal friend of mine to remove it. Since it was a large storm, he had a lot of clients to hit up, but he was going to come three days after the storm. The first day after the storm my neighbor buzz-sawed the fallen limb and took the firewood, leaving all of the small branches for me to clean up. Nowadays my neighbor mows all of his yard into my yard. He starts mowing toward my yard along his driveway and works his way closer and closer to my property, until finally mowing his whole yard into my yard. So I rake it back into his lawn, mostly because I only use a push mower and all of this extra grass would ruin it. One day recently I was walking my dog out back while the neighbor was mowing. As I was nearing my house, my neighbor road his lawnmower diagonally at me quickly and shouted something. I shouted "What was that?!" and he shouted it quieter. When he finished mowing I came outside and asked what did he want to talk about. He asked if I was going to keep "kicking" my grass into his yard and I explained to him why I rake it into his yard. He said big deal, his grass is only a half-inch tall. He said if I do it again he will tell my landlord. He has not mowed since this encounter. There's probably more I can't recall at this moment. These neighbors are easily some of the worst ever. D
HELLO, THIS IS OUR STORY WE HAVE LIVED IN OUR FIRST FOR EIGHT MONTHS AND WE HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE. WHEN I WAS COMING TO CLEAN THE HOUSE UP, BEFORE WE EVEN MOVED IN OUR NEW NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET CAME RUNNING OVER TO WARN ME ABOUT ALL THE OTHER NEIGHBORS.: WHO WAS THE DRUNK; BORROWED EVERYTHING; WHO WAS THE PERSON WHO CALLED THE COPS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND SO ON. AFTER WE MOVED IN AND THIS PERSON'S SON AND MY SON BECAME FRIENDS.(THEY ARE BOTH 7) FROM THE BEGINNING THERE WAS PROBLEMS HER SON WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY MY SON WAS BEING RUDE TO HIM. MY SON WOULD BE IN TROUBLE. AS TIME WENT ON THEY WOULD PLAY OUTSIDE AND I WOULD CATCH THE OTHER CHILD TAKING MY SON'S TOYS,HITTING HIM AND CALLING HORRIBLE NAMES. WHEN I SAID SOMETHING TO HIS MOTHER SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT INVOLVED WITH THE KIDS PROBLEMS. SHE WOULD DO NOTHING!!! ONE DAY I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE AND SPEAK TO THEM (HER HUSBAND AND HER) WE WERE DISCUSSING MORTGAGES AND STUFF AND SHE SAID "SHE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING SPECIAL FINANCIAL HELP FOR OUR HOUSE PAYMENT" I NICELY EXPLAINED THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AND WE WENT TO A BANK APPLIED FOR THE LOAN JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES. HOW RUDE CAN YOU BE TO ASSUME THAT. THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THE FIRST NEIGHBOR THAT COMES TO TALK TO AFTER OR IN THIS CASE BEFORE YOU MOVE IN IS THE ONE WHO MOST LIKELY IS THE ONE THAT CAUSES THE MOST PROBLEMS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. M

I just recently moved into an apartment with a girlfriend of mine. I smoke and while moving into the apartment I threw my butts into the patch of grass directly outside my front door. A few days later another tenant from who lives about 20 doors down from me left a note on my door, (Granted I cleaned up the butts the day after the move) the note said, "Please don’t use our lawn as an ashtray". Then just the other day my roommate was walking to her car and was stopped by an old couple who told her the butts were unacceptable. Now like I said they have been cleaned up for a week no. I do consider this harassment and for two girls who are never home we surely are well known. Also when I go outside to smoke I bring a can with me to throw the butt in, and notice other tenants looking out their windows at me. This is a little rude in my opinion not mention sad that older tenants have nothing better to do than spy on me. Perhaps there are not enough Bingo games going on in the area!

I have a neighbor that continuously sends her kids over to our yard to play without asking permission. When I hire a babysitter, she sends her kids to my home to get free babysitting. Her son picks all the needles off our newly planted pine trees. She has admitted to reading our newspaper without permission and then folding it back into the wrapper and placing it back on our sidewalk. But the rudest thing she has done to date is open our 401 statement and write a note on the envelope saying--"Sorry opened by mistake." She is truly a walking episode of a "Desperate Housewife." When we confronted her husband and her nicely on these issues she said we were overly sensitive. EK, Bolingbrook, IL
I have a neighbor who just purchased his son six dirt bikes. The boy is always riding the dirt bikes with his friends all around the house and in the woods behind our house. His friends come over and they all ride dirt bikes from 9:00 in the morning until it gets dark. It is the most annoying sound. The sad part is that there is never any adult supervision. My kids were riding there scooters and were being harassed by the "cool kids" on their dirt bikes. When I went to say something to the boys I was accused of having a problem!!!!!! All the neighbors are going insane. I am just waiting for someone to explode....... We are thinking about moving just to get away from it..... Maryann, Salem, NH
A few years back my family and I lived next to a small apartment complex. One of the renters, who seemed nice enough, had this annoying habit of cranking his stereo and playing the same song, over and over and over. Soon he started playing just 2-3 seconds of the same song, over and over and over, at all hours. One night, fed up with the repetitive crap I went down there and pounded on his door until it came off the hinges. The door opened. There he lay, unconscious, in a pool of vomit next to an empty bottle of Jack Daniels. I entered his apartment and turned off the music. Then, I poked him with my foot to make sure he was still alive. I wrote him a short note on a post-it, explaining I had entered his apartment because I was concerned for his safety and that next time I would dial 911 to send an ambulance for him, and stuck it to his forehead. I never heard the stereo again... Charlie, San Clemente, CA
My rude neighbor lives directly behind me and consistently discriminates against me for having children. The latest incident happened today; said neighbor says that my children threw chalk in her yard and if it happens again she will be coming over to deal with me and then threw a piece of chalk at me and hastily went in her house and slammed door. Wanda, Temecula, CA
I have a neighbor his family has money to burn, while mine is working class. To him we are trailer trash. He bought this mutt hound dog to bark 24.7, just to annoy us. I confronted him about it this evening; his solution was we could shut our door, or just move. No way am I going to let this a.hole push me out of my own home. I want this scumball to have several really bad days in a row. I want to make his life as miserable as he has made ours. We can't even walk out into our own yard without being accosted by this insane barking. Something has to get done. Really soon. Butch, Ellenboro, wv
